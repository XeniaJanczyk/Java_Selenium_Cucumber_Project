# Java_Selenium_Cucumber_Project

My two final course projects using Java and Selenium WebDriver :

1. Create new address.

Create a user manually at https://mystore-testlab.coderslab.pl.

Write a script that:

- will log in to this created user,
- will enter by clicking on the Addresses tile after logging in (the address we should be at is: https://mystore-testlab.coderslab.pl/index.php?controller=addresses),
- will click on + Create new address,
- will fill out the New address form - the data should be taken from the Examples table in Gherkin (alias, address, city, zip/postal code, country, phone),
- will check if the data in the added address is correct.


2. Make a purchase.

Write a script that:

- logs in the same user
- will select the Hummingbird Printed Sweater for purchase (additional option: make it so that you can check if the discount on it is 20%),
- will choose size M (additional option: make it so that you can parameterize the size and choose S,M,L,XL),
- will select 5 pieces according to the parameter given in the test (additional option: make it so that you can parameterize the number of pieces), add the product to the cart,
- will go to the option - checkout,
- will confirm the address,
- will select the pickup method - PrestaShop "pick up in store",
- will select the payment option - Pay by Check,
- will click on "order with an obligation to pay",
- will take a screenshot of the order confirmation and the amount.
